Artifacts accompanying the paper *"Boundary State Generation for Testing and Improvement of Autonomous Driving Systems"* submitted for publication at Transaction on Software Engineering.

## Overview

Our tool GenBo mutates the initial driving conditions of the ego vehicle to find boundary state pairs in a failure-free environment scenario. In the next step, GenBo uses such boundary state pairs to improve the driving model. The figure below shows the two steps of the approach.
